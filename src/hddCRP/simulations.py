#       Each session's parameters change slightly (fixed within session)
#       Use to ask how well an hddCRP can fit each session's variables as a function of the amount of data (and alpha and distance parameter) 
    # TODO: Generate sequence of X order markov chain matrices
    # TODO: Simulate a time series from an X order markov chain

# TODO: Generate a hddCRP with specific alpha and distances
#  Use to see how well we can recover distance parameter and alphas
